# Contributing to node-red-contrib-chronos
Welcome to the contribution guide of node-red-contrib-chronos. There are many ways to contribute like reporting bugs, proposing new features or providing feedback.

## 🐞 Reporting Problems
If you encountered a bug or other problem, you are welcome to create a **Problem Report** in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jensrossbach/node-red-contrib-chronos/issues). Before creating the issue, please check if the problem has already been reported by someone else. If so, instead of entering a duplicate issue, please add a comment to the existing issue telling about the details of your problem (the more precise the problem reports are, the better they can be distinguished from each other in order to identify duplicates).

Please do not collect multiple problems in one issue, but instead enter one issue per problem. Try to be as precise as possible with your problem description. It is always helpful if you provide screenshots or traces on debug level from the Node-RED service log. Details about how to configure logging and how to retrieve logs can be found [here](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/runtime/logging).

Please always use the **Problem Report** template in the issue tracker as it provides some prefilled hints about which information you should provide in your report.

## 💡 Requesting Features/Changes
In case you need a new feature or think that some existing functionality requires modifications, please first discuss your idea on the [discussion forum](https://github.com/jensrossbach/node-red-contrib-chronos/discussions/categories/ideas) in the **Ideas** category. If the consensus is that this idea is worth being implemented, then and only then create a **Feature Request** in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jensrossbach/node-red-contrib-chronos/issues).

## 🙏 Asking Questions
Have a question or need help? Rather than opening an issue, please ask away on the [discussion forum](https://github.com/jensrossbach/node-red-contrib-chronos/discussions/categories/q-a) in the **Q&A** category. I will try to answer your question as soon as possible.

## 👍 Providing Feedback
Your comments and feedback are welcome, please share your opinion on the [discussion forum](https://github.com/jensrossbach/node-red-contrib-chronos/discussions/categories/feedback) in the **Feedback** category.
