### NOTE
**Please be aware that this version introduces a change that requires adaptation in case you are using the JSONata based filter result evaluation which has been introduced in version 1.12. The condition result array has been changed to be an expression variable instead of an input property. This means it has to be referenced as `$condition` instead of `condition` (note the prepended dollar sign) and any property from the input message with the name "condition" will no longer be renamed.**
