For the calculation of sun and moon position based times, the nodes make use of the great Node.js library [SunCalc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/suncalc) from [Vladimir Agafonkin](https://www.npmjs.com/~mourner). The processing of cron based schedules is done via the Node.js library [CronosJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cronosjs) and date and time algorithms are provided by the Node.js library [Moment.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment).

The map for showing the location coordinates in the configuration node is provided by [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org).
