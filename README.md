# node-red-contrib-chronos

A collection of Node-RED nodes for dealing with fixed and sun or moon position based times.

If you would like to propose a new feature or any kind of improvement or if you want to report a bug, don't hesitate to create an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jensrossbach/node-red-contrib-chronos/issues) of the repository on GitHub. You can also have a look at the [roadmap for the 4th quarter of 2020](https://github.com/jensrossbach/node-red-contrib-chronos/milestone/1) to see what is already planned so far.

Each node supports the input of fixed times in the form of `hh:mm:ss` (seconds optional, 12h and 24h format possible) as well as the selection of sun (sunrise, sunset, dusk, dawn, ...) or moon events (moonrise, moonset). User-defined sun events can be added as well.

#### Scheduler
Schedules the transmission of messages or setting of global/flow variables at specific times.

#### Delay Until
Delays each message passing through the node until a specific time is reached.

#### Time Switch
Routes messages based on their ingress time and date.

#### Time Filter
Filters messages based on their ingress time and date.

For the calculation of sun and moon position based times, the nodes make use of the great Node.js library [SunCalc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/suncalc) from [Vladimir Agafonkin](https://www.npmjs.com/~mourner).
