    <p>
        Configuration of the geographical location and custom sun positions.
    </p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>
        This configuration holds the geographical location in form of latitude
        and longitude. That is required for the calculation of times based on
        sun and moon position. For privacy protection reasons, the coordinates
        are stored as credentials and therefore are not exported with the flows.
        Additionally custom sun positions can be defined in this node. They can
        be used in the other nodes in a similar way as the predefined sun
        positions.
    </p>
    <dt>Name</dt>
    <dd>
        The name of the configuration (optional).
    </dd>
    <dt>Latitude</dt>
    <dd>
        The latitude as floating point value between -90° and 90°.
    </dd>
    <dt>Longitude</dt>
    <dd>
        The longitude as floating point value between -180° and 180°.
    </dd>
    <dt>Custom Sun Positions</dt>
    <dd>
        List of user-defined sun positions. New entries can be added using the
        button below the list. Existing entries can be reordered or deleted.
        Each entry in the list can be configured as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>
                The solar zenith angle above (positive value) or below (negative
                value) the horizon in degrees.
            </li>
            <li>
                The name of the position for rising sun.
            </li>
            <li>
                The name of the position for setting sun.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Names can be composed of letters, digits and underscores, must start
        with a letter and must be unique.
    </dd>
