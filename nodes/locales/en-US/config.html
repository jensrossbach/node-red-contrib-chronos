        Configuration of the geographical location and custom sun positions.
    </p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>
        This configuration holds the geographical location in form of latitude
        and longitude. That is required for the calculation of times based on
        sun and moon position. For privacy protection reasons, the coordinates
        are stored as credentials and therefore are not exported with the flows.
        The map can be used to validate the entered coordinates. If a time zone
        that differs from the time zone of the Node-RED host is required, this
        can also be specified.
        Additionally custom sun positions can be defined in this node. They can
        be used in the other nodes in a similar way as the predefined sun
        positions.
    </p>
    <p>
        For more information, please refer to the detailed documentation in the
        <a href="https://github.com/jensrossbach/node-red-contrib-chronos/wiki/Configuration-Node">repository wiki</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Configuration</h3>
    <dt>Name</dt>
    <dd>
        The name of the configuration (optional).
    </dd>
    <dt>Latitude</dt>
    <dd>
        The latitude as floating point value between -90° and 90°.
    </dd>
    <dt>Longitude</dt>
    <dd>
        The longitude as floating point value between -180° and 180°.
    </dd>
    <dt>Location Detection</dt>
    <dd>
        Press this button to automatically detect your position and fill the
        latitude and longitude fields. The button is only visible if your
        browser supports the geolocation feature. You will be asked for allowance
        of locality determination.
    </dd>
    <dt>Time Zone</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            The name of a valid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones">time zone identifier</a>.
            If omitted, the time zone configured on the host which runs Node-RED
            is used.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Note:</b> A programmatic calculation of the time zone from the
            geographical coordinates is not performed!
        </p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Custom Sun Positions</dt>
    <dd>
        List of user-defined sun positions. New entries can be added using the
        button below the list. Existing entries can be reordered or deleted.
        Each entry in the list can be configured as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>
                The solar zenith angle above (positive value) or below (negative
                value) the horizon in degrees.
            </li>
            <li>
                The name of the position for rising sun.
            </li>
            <li>
                The name of the position for setting sun.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Names can be composed of letters, digits and underscores and must be
        unique.
