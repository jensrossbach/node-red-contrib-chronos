<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="chronos-delay">
    <p>
        Delays each message passing through the node until a specific time
        is reached.
    </p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>
        This node queues incoming messages until a specific time is reached,
        which can be either manually entered or based on sun or moon position.
        When that time has been reached, all messages in the queue are forwarded
        to the output of the node.
    </p>
    <p>
        For more information, please refer to the detailed documentation in the
        <a href="https://github.com/jensrossbach/node-red-contrib-chronos/wiki/Delay-Until-Node">repository wiki</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Configuration</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt>Name</dt>
        <dd>The name of the node (optional).</dd>
        <dt>Configuration</dt>
        <dd>
            A reference to the configuration node to be used.
        </dd>
        <dt>When</dt>
        <dd>
            The target time when queued messages should be forwarded. Depending
            on the selection on the left side, the time can be specified directly,
            a sun or moon position based event can be selected or one of the
            user-defined sun positions can be entered.
        </dd>
        <dt>Offset</dt>
        <dd>
            An offset between -5h and +5h can be specified in minutes. The offset
            will be added to or substracted from the target time.
        </dd>
        <dt>Randomized</dt>
        <dd>
            When selected, the offset will be randomized between 0 and the
            specified value.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Input</h3>
    <p>
        The input message is forwarded as is but can also control the
        queueing behavior of the node when the following properties (of
        any type and value) are existing.
    </p>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>drop<span class="property-type">any</span></dt>
        <dd>
            If present, all message in the queue are dropped without being
            sent out.
        </dd>
        <dt>flush<span class="property-type">any</span></dt>
        <dd>
            If present, all message in the queue are immediately being sent
            out.
        </dd>
        <dt>enqueue<span class="property-type">any</span></dt>
        <dd>
            Can be combined with either of the above properties. If present,
            this message will be enqueued after dropping/flushing.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Outputs</h3>
    <p>
        Delayed messages are sent to the output when the target time has
        been reached.
    </p>
