    <p>
        Delays each message passing through the node until a specific time
        is reached.
    </p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>
        This node queues incoming messages until a specific time is reached,
        which can be either manually entered or based on sun or moon position.
        When that time has been reached, all messages in the queue are forwarded
        to the output of the node.
    </p>
    <p>
        For more information, please refer to the detailed documentation in the
        <a href="https://github.com/jensrossbach/node-red-contrib-chronos/wiki/Delay-Until-Node">repository wiki</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Configuration</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt>Name</dt>
        <dd>The name of the node (optional).</dd>
        <dt>Configuration</dt>
        <dd>
            A reference to the configuration node to be used.
        </dd>
        <dt>When</dt>
        <dd>
            The target time when queued messages should be forwarded. Depending
            on the selection on the left side, the following possibilities are
            available:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>Time of Day</i>: A specific time can be entered directly in the
                    form <code>hh:mm[:ss] [am|pm]</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Sun Position</i>: The sun position can be selected from a list
                    of predefined values.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Moon Position</i>: The moon position can be selected from a list
                    of predefined values.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Custom</i>: One of the user-defined sun position names can be
                    entered.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>Offset</dt>
        <dd>
            An offset between -5h and +5h can be specified in minutes. The offset
            will be added to or substracted from the target time.
        </dd>
        <dt>Randomized</dt>
        <dd>
            When selected, the offset will be randomized between 0 and the
            specified value.
        </dd>
        <dt>Preserve control properties in messages</dt>
        <dd>
            If selected, control properties as described below in chapter
            <i>Input</i> are not deleted from input messages and hence still
            be present in the messages when they are sent to the output port.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Input</h3>
    <p>
        The input message is forwarded as is but can also control the queueing
        behavior of the node if the following properties are existing.
    </p>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt class="optional">drop<span class="property-type">any</span></dt>
        <dd>
            If present, all message in the queue are dropped without being
            sent out.
        </dd>
        <dt class="optional">flush<span class="property-type">any</span></dt>
        <dd>
            If present, all message in the queue are immediately being sent
            out.
        </dd>
        <dt class="optional">enqueue<span class="property-type">any</span></dt>
        <dd>
            Can be combined with either of the above properties. If present,
            this message will be enqueued after dropping/flushing.
        </dd>
        <dt class="optional">when<span class="property-type">object</span></dt>
        <dd>
            Overrides the target time when queued messages should be forwarded,
            see below for details.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        If a property called <code>when</code> is present in the input message,
        the target time for forwarding all currently and later enqueued messages
        is overridden. The property must have the following content:
    </p>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>type<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>Target time type; one of "time", "sun", "moon" or "custom"</dd>
        <dt>value<span class="property-type">string | number</span></dt>
        <dd>Target time value; content is depending on target time type</dd>
        <dt>offset<span class="property-type">number</span></dt>
        <dd>Offset to the target time</dd>
        <dt>random<span class="property-type">boolean</span></dt>
        <dd>Randomized offset</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Outputs</h3>
    <p>
        Delayed messages are sent to the output when the target time has been
        reached or when a message with the <code>flush</code> property is
        received. If a message with the <code>drop</code> property is received,
        the messages are discarded.
    </p>
