<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="chronos-filter">
    <p>
        Filters messages based on their ingress time and date.
    </p>
    <h3>Inputs</h3>
    <p>
        Incoming messages are either handed over to the output or discarded.
    </p>
    <h3>Outputs</h3>
    <p>
        If one or multiple conditions match the message's ingress time and date,
        it is sent out.
    </p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>
        This node is similar to the time switch node but instead of routing
        messages to different output ports, it hands over or discards messages
        depending on different conditions.
    </p>
    <h3>Configuration</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt>Name</dt>
        <dd>The name of the node (optional).</dd>
        <dt>Configuration</dt>
        <dd>
            The configuration with the location to be used for sun/moon position
            calculations.
        </dd>
        <dt>Conditions</dt>
        <dd>
            The list containing the conditions for filtering messages. New entries
            can be added using the button below the list. Existing entries can be
            reordered or deleted. Depending on the selected operator on the left
            side, there are fields for specifying times or time ranges (either
            directly entered, as sun or moon position based event or as user-defined
            sun position), selection of week days or selection of months.
        </dd>
        <dt>All conditions must match</dt>
        <dd>
            If selected, all conditions must match to hand over the message
            (logical AND combination). Otherwise only a single condition must
            match (logical OR combination).
        </dd>
    </dl>
