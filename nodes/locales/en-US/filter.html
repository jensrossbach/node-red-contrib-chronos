        Filters messages based on specific times.
    </p>
   <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>
        This node is similar to the time switch node but instead of routing
        messages to different output ports, it hands over or discards messages
        depending on different conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
        For more information, please refer to the detailed documentation in the
        <a href="https://github.com/jensrossbach/node-red-contrib-chronos/wiki/Time-Filter-Node">repository wiki</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Configuration</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt>Name</dt>
        <dd>The name of the node (optional).</dd>
        <dt>Configuration</dt>
        <dd>
            A reference to the configuration node to be used.
        </dd>
        <dt>Base Time</dt>
        <dd>
            The base time is used for comparison with the operands of the
            conditions. This can be one of:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>message ingress</i>: Ingress time of the input message.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>global</i>, <i>flow</i>, <i>msg</i>: Timestamp from
                    a context variable or message property as number of
                    milliseconds elapsed since the UNIX epoch (or number
                    of milliseconds elapsed since midnight if smaller than
                    86.400.000) or a string containing a time, an ISO 8601
                    datetime or an RFC 2822 datetime.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>Evaluation</dt>
        <dd>
            Specifies the evaluation method for forwarding messages based on the
            results of the conditions. This can be one of:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>logical OR</i>: The message is forwarded if at least one
                    of the conditions evaluates to true.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>logical AND</i>: The message is forwarded only if all
                    conditions evaluate to true.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>annotation</i>: The message is always forwarded and
                    the results of the conditions are stored as array of boolean
                    values in the property <code>msg.evaluation</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>expression</i>: The message is forwarded if the specified
                    JSONata expression evaluates to true. The results of the
                    conditions can be accessed through the variable <code>$condition</code>
                    which is an array of boolean values.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>Conditions</dt>
        <dd>
            The list containing the conditions for filtering messages. New entries
            can be added using the button below the list. Existing entries can be
            reordered or deleted. Depending on the selected operator or source on
            the left side, the following possibilities are available:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Operator <i>before</i>: Checks if the base time is earlier than the
                    specified time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Operator <i>after</i>: Checks if the base time is equal to or later
                    than the specified time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Operator <i>between</i>: Checks if the base time is equal to or later
                    than the first and earlier than the second specified time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Operator <i>outside</i>: Checks if the base time is earlier than the

                <li>
                    Operator <i>days</i>: Checks if the base time matches special days
                    of a month. This can be the first, second, third, fourth, fifth or
                    last day, day of a week, workday or weekend day. Or it can be an
                    even day or a specific day of a specific month or every month. All
                    operands can be negated by activating the <i>Exclude</i> checkbox.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Operator <i>week days</i>: Checks if the base time matches one of
                    the selected week days.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Operator <i>months</i>: Checks if the base time matches one of the
                    selected months.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Source <i>expression</i>: The condition result is taken from the
                    provided JSONata expression. Additional time calculation functions
                    are supported and the base time can be accessed through variable
                    <code>$baseTime</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Source <i>context</i>: Loads the condition from the specified
                    environment or context variable. See section <i>Input</i> below
                    for a description of the required structure for the variable.
                </li>
            </ul>
            For the time input, depending on the selection on the left side, the
            following possibilities are available:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>time of day</i>: A specific time can be entered directly
                    in the form <code>hh:mm[:ss] [am|pm]</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>sun position</i>: The sun position can be selected from
                    a list of predefined values.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>moon position</i>: The moon position can be selected from
                    a list of predefined values.

                <li>
                    <i>env</i>, <i>global</i>, <i>flow</i>, <i>msg</i>: The time is
                    retrieved from an environment variable, a context variable or a
                    message property with a timestamp as number of milliseconds elapsed
                    since the UNIX epoch (or number of milliseconds elapsed since
                    midnight if smaller than 86.400.000) or a string containing a
                    time, an ISO 8601 datetime or an RFC 2822 datetime.
                </li>
            </ul>
            The specified times can additionally be shifted by an (optionally
            randomized) offset, accessible through the double down arrow on the
            right side.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Input</h3>
    <p>
        Incoming messages are either handed over to the output or discarded.
    </p>
    <p>
        Conditions can be dynamically programmed by configuring the corresponding
        condition to be loaded from a context variable (see section <i>Configuration</i>
        above). The appropriate variables must be objects containing the following
        properties:
    </p>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>operator<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>Operator for comparison; one of "before", "after", "between", "outside", "days", "weekdays" or "months"</dd>
        <dt class="optional">operands<span class="property-type">object | array</span></dt>
        <dd>Operands for comparison; content is depending on operator</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        If <code>operator</code> is:
        <ul>
            <li>"before" or "after", <code>operands</code> must be an object</li>
            <li>"between" or "outside", <code>operands</code> must be an array containing two objects corresponding to the first and second operand</li>
        </ul>
        The objects must each include the following properties:
    </p>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>type<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>Operand type; one of "time", "sun", "moon" or "custom"</dd>
        <dt>value<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>Operand value; content is depending on operand type</dd>
        <dt>offset<span class="property-type">number</span></dt>
        <dd>Offset to the operand time</dd>
        <dt>random<span class="property-type">boolean</span></dt>
        <dd>Randomized offset</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        If <code>operator</code> is "days", <code>operands</code> must be
        an object containing the following properties:
    </p>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>type<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>
            Operand type; one of "first", "second", "third", "fourth",
            "fifth", "last", "even" or "specific"
        </dd>
        <dt class="optional">day<span class="property-type">string | number</span></dt>
        <dd>
            Depending on the operand type the name of a day or the day
            of the month as number; not applicable for type "even"
        </dd>
        <dt class="optional">month<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>Name of the month; only applicable for type "specific"</dd>
        <dt>exclude<span class="property-type">boolean</span></dt>
        <dd>Negated result</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        If <code>operator</code> is "weekdays", <code>operands</code>
        must be an object. It may contain boolean properties with names of
        days of the week. If <code>true</code>, the condition is fullfilled
        for base times on that day or not fulfilled if the property is
        <code>false</code> or not present.
    </p>
    <p>
        If <code>operator</code> is "months", <code>operands</code>
        must be an object. It may contain boolean properties with names of
        months of the year. If <code>true</code>, the condition is fullfilled
        for base times in that month or not fulfilled if the property is
        <code>false</code> or not present.
    </p>
    <h3>Outputs</h3>
    <p>
        If one or multiple conditions match the configured base time according
        to the specified evaluation method, the message is sent out.
    </p>
    <p>
        Only if evaluation method <i>annotation</i> is activated:
    </p>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>evaluation<span class="property-type">array</span></dt>
        <dd>Contains evaluation results of every condition</dd>
    </dl>
