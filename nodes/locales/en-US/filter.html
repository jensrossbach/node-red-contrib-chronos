    <p>
        Filters messages based on specific times.
    </p>
   <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>
        This node is similar to the time switch node but instead of routing
        messages to different output ports, it hands over or discards messages
        depending on different conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
        For more information, please refer to the detailed documentation in the
        <a href="https://github.com/jensrossbach/node-red-contrib-chronos/wiki/Time-Filter-Node">repository wiki</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Configuration</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt>Name</dt>
        <dd>The name of the node (optional).</dd>
        <dt>Configuration</dt>
        <dd>
            A reference to the configuration node to be used.
        </dd>
        <dt>Base Time</dt>
        <dd>
            The base time is used for comparison with the operands of the
            conditions. This can be one of:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>message ingress</i>: Ingress time of the input message.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>global.</i>: Timestamp from a global variable as number
                    of milliseconds elapsed since the UNIX epoch.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>flow.</i>: Timestamp from a flow variable as number of
                    milliseconds elapsed since the UNIX epoch.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>msg.</i>: Timestamp from a message property as number of
                    milliseconds elapsed since the UNIX epoch.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>Conditions</dt>
        <dd>
            The list containing the conditions for filtering messages. New entries
            can be added using the button below the list. Existing entries can be
            reordered or deleted. Depending on the selected operator on the left
            side, the following possibilities are available:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>before</i>: Checks if the base time is earlier than the
                    specified time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>after</i>: Checks if the base time is equal to or later
                    than the specified time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>between</i>: Checks if the base time is equal to or later
                    than the first and earlier than the second specified time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>outside</i>: Checks if the base time is earlier than the
                    first or later than the second specified time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>week days</i>: Checks if the base time matches one of
                    the selected week days.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>months</i>: Checks if the base time matches one of the
                    selected months.
                </li>
            </ul>
            For the time input, depending on the selection on the left side, the
            following possibilities are available:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>Time of Day</i>: A specific time can be entered directly
                    in the form <code>hh:mm[:ss] [am|pm]</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Sun Position</i>: The sun position can be selected from
                    a list of predefined values.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Moon Position</i>: The moon position can be selected from
                    a list of predefined values.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Custom</i>: One of the user-defined sun position names
                    can be entered.
                </li>
            </ul>
            The specified times can additionally be shifted by an (optionally
            randomized) offset, accessible through the double down arrow on the
            right side.
        </dd>
        <dt>All conditions must match</dt>
        <dd>
            If selected, all conditions must match to hand over the message
            (logical AND combination). Otherwise only a single condition must
            match (logical OR combination).
        </dd>
        <dt>Annotate only, do not filter</dt>
        <dd>
            If selected, incoming messages are forwarded in any case and the
            evaluation results of each condition are stored in property
            <code>msg.evaluation</code>.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Input</h3>
    <p>
        Incoming messages are either handed over to the output or discarded.
    </p>
    <h3>Outputs</h3>
    <p>
        If one or multiple conditions match the configured base time or if
        <i>Annotate only, do not filter</i> is activated, the message is sent
        out.
    </p>
    <p>
        Only if <i>Annotate only, do not filter</i> is activated:
    </p>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>evaluation<span class="property-type">array</span></dt>
        <dd>Contains evaluation results of every condition</dd>
    </dl>
