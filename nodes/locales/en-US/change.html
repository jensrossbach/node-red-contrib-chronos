        Sets or changes time values from message properties, flow variables or
        global variables.

    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>
        This node sets message properties, flow variables or global variables
        to specific times or manipulates and converts timestamps from these
        input fields. Multiple actions can be configured per node which will be
        executed in the specified order. It is also possible to chain different
        actions for the same property or variable.
    </p>
    <p>
        For more information, please refer to the detailed documentation in the
        <a href="https://github.com/jensrossbach/node-red-contrib-chronos/wiki/Time-Change-Node">repository wiki</a>.

    <h3>Configuration</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt>Name</dt>
        <dd>The name of the node (optional).</dd>
        <dt>Configuration</dt>
        <dd>
            A reference to the configuration node to be used.

        <dd>
            <p>
                The list containing the rules for setting or changing target
                values. New entries can be added using the button below the
                list. Existing entries can be reordered or deleted. The following
                actions can be selected:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <i>Set</i>: Sets the selected target to a specific date
                        and time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>Change</i>: Modifies the timestamp value of the
                        selected target according to the configured manipulation
                        and conversion rules. The original target value can be
                        either a number containing the milliseconds elapsed since
                        the UNIX epoch or a string containing a date and time
                        which must be parsable according to
                        <a href="https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string/">Moment.js documentation</a>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                To the right of the rule action, the target to set or change
                can be selected. This can be either a message property, a flow
                variable or a global variable.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the set action, either the current date and time can be used
                or a manually entered date and time can be specified. The date
                has to be entered in the form <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>, the time
                can be provided in the following ways:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <i>time of day</i>: A specific time can be entered
                        directly in the form <code>hh:mm[:ss] [am|pm]</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>sun position</i>: The sun position can be selected
                        from a list of predefined values.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>moon position</i>: The moon position can be selected
                        from a list of predefined values.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>custom</i>: One of the user-defined sun position
                        names can be entered.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                For the change action, different types of manipulation and
                conversion can be selected:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <i>Set</i>: Modifies a part of the target timestamp.
                        The part to be changed can be selected in the dropdown
                        box.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>Add</i>: Adds time to the target timestamp. The amount
                        of time has to entered as number and the unit of time
                        to be added can be selected in the dropdown box.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>Subtract</i>: Similar to <i>Add</i>, but subtracts
                        time from the target timestamp.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>Start of</i>: Sets the target timestamp to the start
                        of a unit of time. The latter can be selected in the
                        dropdown box.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>End of</i>: Similar to <i>Start of</i>, but sets the
                        target timestamp to the end of a unit of time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>Convert</i>: Converts the target timestamp to a
                        string representation. The format of the string is
                        specified via the text box and must follow the rules
                        from the <a href="https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/">Moment.js documentation</a>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
