    <p>
        Schedules the transmission of messages or setting of global/flow variables
        at specific times.
    </p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>
        This node can send messages or set global or flow variables at specific
        times which are either manually entered or based on sun or moon position.
        Multiple events can be planned and each can have a different trigger
        time and produce a different kind of output.
    </p>
    <p>
        For more information, please refer to the detailed documentation in the
        <a href="https://github.com/jensrossbach/node-red-contrib-chronos/wiki/Scheduler-Node">repository wiki</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Configuration</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt>Name</dt>
        <dd>The name of the node (optional).</dd>
        <dt>Configuration</dt>
        <dd>
            A reference to the configuration node to be used.
        </dd>
        <dt>Schedule</dt>
        <dd>
            The list containing the scheduled events. New entries can be added
            using the button below the list. Existing entries can be reordered
            or deleted. For each entry, a schedule time and an output can be
            configured:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The trigger time can be specified depending on the selection
                    on the left side with the following possibilities:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <i>Time of Day</i>: A specific time can be entered
                            directly in the form <code>hh:mm[:ss] [am|pm]</code>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <i>Sun Position</i>: The sun position can be
                            selected from a list of predefined values.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <i>Moon Position</i>: The moon position can be
                            selected from a list of predefined values.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <i>Custom</i>: One of the user-defined sun position
                            names can be entered.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    An offset between -5h and +5h can be specified in minutes.
                    The offset will be added to or substracted from the event
                    time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the checkbox on the right side is selected, the offset
                    will be randomized between 0 and the specified value.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The output can either be a full message, expressed in JSON
                    form, a single message property of different types, a flow
                    variable or a global variable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When selecting <i>global.</i> or <i>flow.</i> in the first
                    row, the schedule event will be loaded from the specified
                    context variable. See chapter <i>Input</i> below for a
                    description of the required structure for the global or
                    flow variable.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>Dedicated output ports for schedule events</dt>
        <dd>
            If selected, for each event which produces a message as output, a
            dedicated output port will be created and the output message of the
            event will be sent to the assigned output port. For dynamically
            programmed schedule events via context variables, an output port
            will always be created as it is not known at configuration time, if
            the event will produce an output message or not.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Input</h3>
    <dt>Enable/disable schedule</dt>
    <dd>
        The input message can be used to either disable or re-enable the schedule
        or parts of it. Enabling the schedule will also reload any programmed
        schedule events from context variables.
    </dd>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>payload<span class="property-type">boolean | array</span></dt>
        <dd>Switch(es) for enabling or disabling schedule events</dd>
    </dl>
    <dd>
        If <code>msg.payload</code> is a boolean value, whole schedule is enabled
        if true and disabled otherwise. If <code>msg.payload</code> is an array,
        each element must be a boolean value and corresponds to the event in the
        schedule at the same index. If the value is true, the matching event is
        enabled, otherwise it is disabled.
    </dd>
    <dt>Dynamically program schedule</dt>
    <dd>
        The schedule (or parts of it) can be dynamically programmed by setting
        the corresponding event configuration to be loaded from a context variable
        (see chapter <i>Configuration</i> above). The appropriate variables must
        be objects containing the following properties:
    </dd>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>trigger.type<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>Trigger type; one of "time", "sun", "moon" or "custom"</dd>
        <dt>trigger.value<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>Trigger value; content is depending on trigger type</dd>
        <dt>trigger.offset<span class="property-type">number</span></dt>
        <dd>Offset to the trigger time</dd>
        <dt>trigger.random<span class="property-type">boolean</span></dt>
        <dd>Randomized offset</dd>
        <dt>output.type<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>Output type; one of "global", "flow", "msg" or "fullMsg"</dd>
        <dt class="optional">output.value<span class="property-type">object</span></dt>
        <dd>Only if output type is "fullMsg"; defines output message content</dd>
        <dt class="optional">output.property.name<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>Only if output type is not "fullMsg"; name of output property/variable</dd>
        <dt class="optional">output.property.type<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>Optionally set to "date" and leave <code>output.property.value</code> undefined to have same behavior as if selecting timestamp type in UI</dd>
        <dt class="optional">output.property.value<span class="property-type">any</span></dt>
        <dd>Only if output type is not "fullMsg"; value of output property/variable</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Outputs</h3>
    <p>
        Scheduled messages are sent to the output of this node. The structure and
        content of the message can be statically defined through the configuration
        or dynamically programmed via context variables.
    </p>
