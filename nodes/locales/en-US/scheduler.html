<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="chronos-scheduler">
    <p>
        Schedules the transmission of messages or setting of global/flow variables
        at specific times.
    </p>
    <h3>Inputs</h3>
    <p>
        The input message can be used to either disable or re-enable the schedule
        or parts of it.
    </p>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>payload<span class="property-type">boolean | array</span></dt>
        <dd>Switch(es) for enabling or disabling schedule events</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        If <code>msg.payload</code> is a boolean value, whole schedule is enabled
        if true and disabled otherwise. If <code>msg.payload</code> is an array,
        each element must be a boolean value and corresponds to the event in the
        schedule at the same index. If the value is true, the matching event is
        enabled, otherwise it is disabled.
    </p>
    <h3>Outputs</h3>
    <p>
        Scheduled messages are sent to the output of this node. The structure and
        content of the message can be defined through the configuration.
    </p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>
        This node can send messages or set global or flow variables at specific
        times which are either manually entered or based on sun or moon position.
        Multiple events can be planned and each can have a different trigger
        time and produce a different kind of output.
    </p>
    <h3>Configuration</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt>Name</dt>
        <dd>The name of the node (optional).</dd>
        <dt>Configuration</dt>
        <dd>
            A reference to the configuration node to be used.
        </dd>
        <dt>Schedule</dt>
        <dd>
            The list containing the scheduled events. New entries can be added
            using the button below the list. Existing entries can be reordered
            or deleted. For each entry, a schedule time and an output can be
            configured:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Depending on the selection on the left side, the time can
                    be specified directly, a sun or moon position based event
                    can be selected or one of the user-defined sun positions
                    can be entered.
                </li>
                <li>
                    An offset between -5h and +5h can be specified in minutes.
                    The offset will be added to or substracted from the event
                    time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the checkbox on the right side is selected, the offset
                    will be randomized between 0 and the specified value.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The output can either be a full message, expressed in JSON
                    form, a single message property of different types, a flow
                    variable or a global variable.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>Dedicated output ports for schedule events</dt>
        <dd>
            If selected, for each event which produces a message as output, a
            dedicated output port will be created and the output message of the
            event will be sent to the assigned output port.
        </dd>
    </dl>
