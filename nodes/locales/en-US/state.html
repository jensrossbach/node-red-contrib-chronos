        Maintains a state whose value is changed at specific times under
        consideration of specific conditions.
    </p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>
        This node can send messages or set global or flow variables whenever
        the internally maintained state changes and optionally at node start.
        Multiple state values can be configured and each can have a different
        trigger time. Additionally, multiple conditions can be defined which
        are applied to each state change.
    </p>
    <p>
        For more information, please refer to the detailed documentation in the
        <a href="https://github.com/jensrossbach/node-red-contrib-chronos/wiki/State-Node">repository wiki</a>.

            The list containing the state values. New entries can be added
            using the button below the list. Existing entries can be reordered
            or deleted. For each entry, a trigger time and the state value can
            be configured:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The trigger time can be specified depending on the selection
                    on the left side with the following possibilities:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <i>time of day</i>: A specific time can be entered

                        <li>
                            <i>manual trigger</i>: State will not be activated
                            automatically but can only be activated manually
                            via an input message. See <code>set</code> command
                            in section <i>Input</i> below for details.
                        </li>

                <li>
                    An offset between -300 and +300 can be specified in minutes.
                    The offset will be added to or subtracted from the event
                    time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a randomization value between 1 and 300 minutes is
                    specified, the offset will be randomly choosen from a
                    time span of the entered width. The offset value denotes
                    the center of the randomization span in this case.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The state value can be one of several Node-RED defined data

            The evaluation specifies the method of combining the results
            of the conditions. This can be one of:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>logical AND</i>: Upon triggered, the state is changed
                    only if all conditions evaluate to true.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>logical OR</i>: Upon triggered, the state is changed
                    if at least one of the conditions evaluates to true.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>expression</i>: Upon triggered, the state is changed
                    if the specified JSONata expression evaluates to true.
                    The results of the conditions can be accessed through
                    the variable <code>$condition</code> which is an array
                    of boolean values.
                </li>
            </ul>
            The list contains the conditions for restricting the state changes.
            New entries can be added using the button below the list. Existing
            entries can be reordered or deleted. Depending on the selected
            operator on the left side, the following possibilities are available:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Operator <i>days</i>: Checks if the trigger time matches
                    special days of a month. This can be the first, second, third,
                    fourth, fifth or last day, day of a week, workday or weekend
                    day. Or it can be an even day or a specific day of a specific
                    month or every month. All operands can be negated by activating
                    the <i>Exclude</i> checkbox.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Operator <i>week days</i>: Checks if the trigger time matches
                    one of the selected week days.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Operator <i>months</i>: Checks if the trigger time matches one
                    of the selected months.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>Output current state on start</dt>
        <dd>
            If selected, the current state will be output when the node starts
            in the same way as if a state change happened. Optionally you can
            choose a delay after which the output is produced (defaults to 0.1
            seconds).
        </dd>
        <dt>Passive trigger mode</dt>
        <dd>
            If selected, the state node will not actively change states upon
            reaching their trigger times. Instead, state changes must be
            triggered by an external timer source (such as a scheduler node)
            via input message. See <code>trigger</code> command in section
            <i>Input</i> below for further information.

        <code>msg.topic</code> must be set to a string containing the command
        to be executed. Depending on the command, <code>msg.payload</code>
        might be required as well.
    </dd>
    <dd>
        The following commands are currently supported:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>trigger</code>: Only supported in passive trigger mode.
                If <code>msg.payload</code> contains a valid identifier of a
                configured state, that state will be activated provided that
                the configured conditions are met. If <code>msg.payload</code>
                is not set, checks if the trigger time of a configured state
                is reached and in this case activates the state provided
                that the conditions are met. If the state actually changed
                by this action, the current value of the state will be sent
                or stored.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>get</code>: Explicitly sends or stores the current state
                value.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>getid</code>: Sends a message with the identifier of the
                currently active state in <code>msg.payload</code> to the output
                port. The message contains the original <code>msg.topic</code>
                property with "getid" in order to distinguish it from normal
                state change output messages.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>set</code>: Sets the current state unconditionally to the
                configured state with the identifier in <code>msg.payload</code>.
                If the state actually changed by this action, the current value
                of the state will be sent or stored. Optionally, a timeout can
                be specified in <code>msg.timeout</code>. After the timeout has
                elapsed, the state is restored in the same way as the <code>reset</code>
                command does. The timeout can be specified as number of minutes
                or as an object containing the properties <code>seconds</code>,
                <code>minutes</code> and/or <code>hours</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>reset</code>: Sets the state back to its original value
                according to the configured trigger time and conditions. If the
                state actually changed by this action, the current value of the
                state will be sent or stored.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>reload</code>: Forces state triggers to be recalculated
                (also reloads programmed data from environment and context
                variables).
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>pause</code>: Suppresses automatic state changes when
                trigger times have been reached. Does nothing if passive trigger
                mode is enabled.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>resume</code>: Resumes automatic state changes. Does
                nothing if passive trigger mode is enabled. Note that this
                command does not reset the current state to the state that
                would have normally been activated during paused period.
                Additionally use the <code>reset</code> command to also have
                the state reset.

        Whenever the state changes and the output is configured to be a message
        property or a full message, a message containing the state value is
        sent to the output port of this node. Additionally, a response to the
        "getid" command may be sent to the output port.
