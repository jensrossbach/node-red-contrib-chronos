    <p>
        Repeats each message passing through the node based on a configurable
        interval.
    </p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>
        This node forwards an incoming message upon reception and then periodically
        sends this messages according to the configured interval. The repetition
        ends when a new message is received and optionally at a specific time.
    </p>
    <p>
        For more information, please refer to the detailed documentation in the
        <a href="https://github.com/jensrossbach/node-red-contrib-chronos/wiki/Repeat-Node">repository wiki</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Configuration</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt>Name</dt>
        <dd>The name of the node (optional).</dd>
        <dt>Configuration</dt>
        <dd>
            A reference to the configuration node to be used.
        </dd>
        <dt>Interval</dt>
        <dd>
            The interval for message sending repetition which can be expressed
            in seconds, minutes or hours.
        </dd>
        <dt>Until</dt>
        <dd>
            The condition when periodic message sending should stop. A subsequently
            received message always stops the repetition of the previous message.
            Additonally a specific time can be configured as ending condition for
            message sending repetition. Depending on the selection, the following
            possibilities are available:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>next message</i>: Repetition is only stopped when receiving
                    another message.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>time of day</i>: A specific ending time can be entered directly
                    in the form <code>hh:mm[:ss] [am|pm]</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>sun position</i>: The sun position can be selected from a list
                    of predefined values.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>moon position</i>: The moon position can be selected from a list
                    of predefined values.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>custom</i>: One of the user-defined sun position names can be
                    entered.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>Offset</dt>
        <dd>
            An offset between -300 and +300 can be specified in minutes. The offset
            will be added to or substracted from the repetition ending time.
        </dd>
        <dt>Randomized</dt>
        <dd>
            When selected, the offset will be randomized between 0 and the
            specified value.
        </dd>
        <dt>Preserve control properties in messages</dt>
        <dd>
            If selected, control properties as described below in chapter
            <i>Input</i> are not deleted from input messages and hence still
            be present in the messages when they are sent to the output port.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Input</h3>
    <p>
        The input message is forwarded as is but can also control the repetition
        behavior of the node if the following properties are existing.
    </p>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt class="optional">stop<span class="property-type">any</span></dt>
        <dd>
            If present, message sending repetition is immediately stopped.
            The message containing this property is discarded.
        </dd>
        <dt class="optional">interval<span class="property-type">object</span></dt>
        <dd>
            Overrides the interval for message sending repetition, see below
            for details.
        </dd>
        <dt class="optional">until<span class="property-type">object</span></dt>
        <dd>
            Overrides the condition when message sending repetition should end,
            see below for details.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        If a property called <code>interval</code> is present in the input
        message, the interval for repetition is overridden. The property must
        have the following content:
    </p>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>value<span class="property-type">number</span></dt>
        <dd>The duration of the interval</dd>
        <dt>unit<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>The unit for the interval duration, one of "seconds", "minutes" or "hours"</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        If a property called <code>until</code> is present in the input message,
        the condition when message sending repetition should end is overridden.
        The property may be <code>null</code>, in this case the repetition ends
        only upon reception of the next message. Otherwise the property must
        have the following content:
    </p>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>type<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>Ending time type; one of "time", "sun", "moon" or "custom"</dd>
        <dt>value<span class="property-type">string | number</span></dt>
        <dd>Ending time value; content is depending on ending time type</dd>
        <dt>offset<span class="property-type">number</span></dt>
        <dd>Offset to the ending time</dd>
        <dt>random<span class="property-type">boolean</span></dt>
        <dd>Randomized offset</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Outputs</h3>
    <p>
        Messages are sent to the output upon reception and periodically until
        the next message or a message with the property <code>stop</code> has
        been received. If configured, message sending repetition also ends when
        the ending time has been reached.
    </p>
