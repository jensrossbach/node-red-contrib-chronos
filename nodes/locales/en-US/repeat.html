    <p>
        Repeats each message passing through the node based on a configurable
        interval.
    </p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>
        This node forwards an incoming message upon reception and then periodically
        sends this messages according to the configured interval or cron-like
        schedule. The repetition ends when a new message is received and optionally
        at a specific time.
    </p>
    <p>
        For more information, please refer to the detailed documentation in the
        <a href="https://github.com/jensrossbach/node-red-contrib-chronos/wiki/Repeat-Node">repository wiki</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Configuration</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt>Name</dt>
        <dd>The name of the node (optional).</dd>
        <dt>Configuration</dt>
        <dd>
            A reference to the configuration node to be used.
        </dd>
        <dt>Mode</dt>
        <dd>
            The repetition mode which can be either simple (see "Interval" below),
            advanced (see "Cron Table" below) or custom (see "Expression" below).
        </dd>
        <dt>Interval</dt>
        <dd>
            In simple mode, this specifies the interval for message sending repetition
            which can be expressed in seconds, minutes or hours.
        </dd>
        <dt>Cron Table</dt>
        <dd>
            In advanced mode, this specifies the cron-based schedule for message
            repetition which must be entered according to
            <a href="https://github.com/jaclarke/cronosjs#supported-expression-syntax">CronosJS expression syntax</a>.
        </dd>
        <dt>Repetition</dt>
        <dd>
            In custom mode, when <i>expression</i> is selected, this specifies a
            JSONata expression that is evaluated on each iteration and must result
            in a time value for the next iteration. The time value can either be a
            number containing the amount of milliseconds until the next trigger or
            the amount of milliseconds elapsed since the UNIX epoch representing
            the absolute time of the next trigger. Or it is a valid datetime string
            representing the absolute time of the next trigger. The string must be
            parseable according to <a href="https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string/">Moment.js documentation</a>.
            When selecting <i>global</i> or <i>flow</i>, the repetition is taken
            from the specified context variable. See section <i>Input</i> below
            for a description of the format (properties <code>interval</code>
            and <code>crontab</code>).
        </dd>
        <dt>Until</dt>
        <dd>
            The condition when periodic message sending should stop. A subsequently
            received message always stops the repetition of the previous message.
            Additonally a time-based or custom ending condition can be configured
            for message sending repetition. Depending on the selection, the following
            possibilities are available:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>next message</i>: Repetition is only stopped when receiving
                    another message.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>time of day</i>: A specific ending time can be entered directly
                    in the form <code>hh:mm[:ss] [am|pm]</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>sun position</i>: The sun position can be selected from a list
                    of predefined values.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>moon position</i>: The moon position can be selected from a list
                    of predefined values.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>custom sun position</i>: One of the user-defined sun position names can be
                    entered.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>expression</i>: A JSONata expression can be entered which should
                    evaluate to either <code>false</code> (ending condition not reached)
                    or <code>true</code> (ending condition reached). The time of the
                    next trigger can be accessed via expression variable <code>$next</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>global</i>: Ending condition will be loaded from the specified global
                    context variable, see section <i>Input</i> (property <code>until</code>)
                    below for a description of the format.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>flow</i>: Ending condition will be loaded from the specified flow
                    context variable, see section <i>Input</i> (property <code>until</code>)
                    below for a description of the format.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>Date</dt>
        <dd>
            A date can be provided in the form <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> for the
            ending time. If omitted, the date of the message ingress is used.
        </dd>
        <dt>Offset</dt>
        <dd>
            An offset between -300 and +300 can be specified in minutes. The offset
            will be added to or subtracted from the repetition ending time.
        </dd>
        <dt>Randomized</dt>
        <dd>
            When selected, the offset will be randomized between 0 and the
            specified value.
        </dd>
        <dt>When message arrives on input</dt>
        <dd>
            Specifies the behavior upon message ingress.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>do nothing</i>: The message is not forwarded on ingress,
                    next sending of the message happens after the first interval
                    has passed (provided that the end condition is not reached).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>forward message</i>: The message is immediately forwarded
                    provided that the end time is not exceeded or no end time has
                    been set.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>forced forward message</i>: The message is immediately
                    forwarded regardless if the end time has been exceeded or
                    not.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>Preserve control properties in messages</dt>
        <dd>
            If selected, control properties as described below in section
            <i>Input</i> are not deleted from input messages and hence are still
            present in the messages when they are sent to the output port.
        </dd>
        <dt>Ignore control properties in messages</dt>
        <dd>
            If selected, control properties as described below in section
            <i>Input</i> are ignored. This is useful if messages to be repeated
            contain properties with the same names as the control properties
            and hence prevents their misinterpretation.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Input</h3>
    <p>
        The input message is forwarded as is but can also control the
        behavior of the node for that message if the following properties are
        existing.
    </p>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt class="optional">stop<span class="property-type">any</span></dt>
        <dd>
            If present, message sending repetition is immediately stopped.
            The message containing this property is discarded.
        </dd>
        <dt class="optional">interval<span class="property-type">object</span></dt>
        <dd>
            Overrides the interval for message sending repetition, see below
            for details.
        </dd>
        <dt class="optional">crontab<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>
            Overrides the cron table for message sending repetition.
        </dd>
        <dt class="optional">until<span class="property-type">object</span></dt>
        <dd>
            Overrides the condition when message sending repetition should end,
            see below for details.
        </dd>
        <dt class="optional">ingress<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>
            Overrides the behavior upon message ingress. Possible values are
            "noop", "forward" and "forward:forced".
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        If a property called <code>interval</code> is present in the input
        message, the interval for repetition is overridden. The property must
        have the following content:
    </p>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>value<span class="property-type">number</span></dt>
        <dd>The duration of the interval</dd>
        <dt>unit<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>The unit for the interval duration, one of "seconds", "minutes" or "hours"</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        If a property called <code>until</code> is present in the input message,
        the condition when message sending repetition should end is overridden.
        The property may be <code>null</code>, in this case the repetition ends
        only upon reception of the next message. Otherwise the property must
        have the following content:
    </p>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>type<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>Ending time type; one of "time", "sun", "moon" or "custom"</dd>
        <dt>value<span class="property-type">string | number</span></dt>
        <dd>Ending time value; content is depending on ending time type</dd>
        <dt class="optional">date<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>Ending date in the form <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code></dd>
        <dt class="optional">offset<span class="property-type">number</span></dt>
        <dd>Offset to the ending time</dd>
        <dt class="optional">random<span class="property-type">boolean</span></dt>
        <dd>Randomized offset</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Outputs</h3>
    <p>
        Messages are sent to the output upon reception and periodically until
        the next message or a message with the property <code>stop</code> has
        been received. If configured, message sending repetition also ends when
        the ending time has been reached.
    </p>
