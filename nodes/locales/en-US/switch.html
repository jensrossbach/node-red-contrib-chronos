        Routes messages based on specific times.
    </p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>
        This node routes incoming messages to output ports based on the time
        of arrival or a timestamp specified via a message property, global
        variable or flow variable.
    </p>
    <p>
        For more information, please refer to the detailed documentation in the
        <a href="https://github.com/jensrossbach/node-red-contrib-chronos/wiki/Time-Switch-Node">repository wiki</a>.

        <dt>Conditions</dt>
        <dd>
            The list containing the conditions for routing messages to output
            ports. New entries can be added using the button below the list.
            Existing entries can be reordered or deleted. Depending on the
            selected operator or source on the left side, the following
            possibilities are available:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Operator <i>before</i>: Checks if the base time is earlier than the
                    specified time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Operator <i>after</i>: Checks if the base time is equal to or later
                    than the specified time.

                    Operator <i>days</i>: Checks if the base time matches special days
                    of a month. This can be the first, second, third, fourth, fifth or
                    last day, day of a week, workday or weekend day. Or it can be an
                    even day or a specific day of a specific month or every month. All
                    operands can be negated by activating the <i>Exclude</i> checkbox.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Operator <i>week days</i>: Checks if the base time matches one of

                    Operator <i>months</i>: Checks if the base time matches one of the
                    selected months.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Operator <i>otherwise</i>: Evaluates to true if all other conditions
                    do not match.

                <li>
                    Source <i>expression</i>: The condition result is taken from the
                    provided JSONata expression. Additional time calculation functions
                    are supported and the base time can be accessed through variable
                    <code>$baseTime</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Source <i>context</i>: Loads the condition from the specified
                    context variable. See chapter <i>Input</i> below for a description
                    of the required structure for the global or flow variable.
                </li>
            </ul>
            For the time input, depending on the selection on the left side, the
            following possibilities are available:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>time of day</i>: A specific time can be entered directly
                    in the form <code>hh:mm[:ss] [am|pm]</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>sun position</i>: The sun position can be selected from
                    a list of predefined values.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>moon position</i>: The moon position can be selected from
                    a list of predefined values.

                    <i>custom sun position</i>: One of the user-defined sun position names
                    can be entered.
                </li>
            </ul>
            The specified times can additionally be shifted by an (optionally
            randomized) offset, accessible through the double down arrow on the
            right side.
        </dd>
        <dt>Stop on first match</dt>
        <dd>
            If selected, evaluation of conditions is stopped on the first match,
            i.e. message are never routed to more than one output port.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Input</h3>
    <p>
        Incoming messages are routed to none, one or multiple of the configured
        output ports. If the message is delivered to more than one port, it will
        be cloned at each but the first port.
    </p>
    <p>
        Conditions can be dynamically programmed by configuring the corresponding
        condition to be loaded from a context variable (see chapter <i>Configuration</i>
        above). The appropriate variables must be objects containing the following
        properties:
    </p>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>operator<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>Operator for comparison; one of "before", "after", "between", "outside", "days", "weekdays", "months" or "otherwise"</dd>
        <dt class="optional">operands<span class="property-type">object | array</span></dt>
        <dd>Operands for comparison; content is depending on operator</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        If <code>operator</code> is:
        <ul>
            <li>"before" or "after", <code>operands</code> must be an object</li>
            <li>"between" or "outside", <code>operands</code> must be an array containing two objects corresponding to the first and second operand</li>
        </ul>
        The objects must each include the following properties:
    </p>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>type<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>Operand type; one of "time", "sun", "moon" or "custom"</dd>
        <dt>value<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>Operand value; content is depending on operand type</dd>
        <dt>offset<span class="property-type">number</span></dt>
        <dd>Offset to the operand time</dd>
        <dt>random<span class="property-type">boolean</span></dt>
        <dd>Randomized offset</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        If <code>operator</code> is "days", <code>operands</code> must be
        an object containing the following properties:
    </p>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>type<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>
            Operand type; one of "first", "second", "third", "fourth",
            "fifth", "last", "even" or "specific"
        </dd>
        <dt class="optional">day<span class="property-type">string | number</span></dt>
        <dd>
            Depending on the operand type the name of a day or the day
            of the month as number; not applicable for type "even"
        </dd>
        <dt class="optional">month<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>Name of the month; only applicable for type "specific"</dd>
        <dt>exclude<span class="property-type">boolean</span></dt>
        <dd>Negated result</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        If <code>operator</code> is "weekdays", <code>operands</code>
        must be an object. It may contain boolean properties with names of
        days of the week. If <code>true</code>, the condition is fullfilled
        for base times on that day or not fulfilled if the property is
        <code>false</code> or not present.
    </p>
    <p>
        If <code>operator</code> is "months", <code>operands</code>
        must be an object. It may contain boolean properties with names of
        months of the year. If <code>true</code>, the condition is fullfilled
        for base times in that month or not fulfilled if the property is
        <code>false</code> or not present.
    </p>
    <p>
        If <code>operator</code> is "otherwise", <code>operands</code>
        is not required.
    </p>
    <h3>Outputs</h3>
    <p>
        Each output port is dedicated to a specific condition which is evaluated
        against the base time.
