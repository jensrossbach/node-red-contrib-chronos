    </p>
    <h3>Inputs</h3>
    <p>
        Incoming messages are routed to none, one or multiple of the configured
        output ports. If more than one condition is specified and <i>Stop on
        first match</i> is not selected, messages are always cloned at the
        output ports.
    </p>
    <h3>Outputs</h3>
    <p>
        Each output port is dedicated to a specific condition which is evaluated
        against the message's ingress time and date.
    </p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>
        This node routes incoming messages to output ports based on the time
