        Routes messages based on their ingress time and date.

    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>
        This node routes incoming messages to output ports based on the time
        and date of arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
        For more information, please refer to the detailed documentation in the
        <a href="https://github.com/jensrossbach/node-red-contrib-chronos/wiki/Time-Switch-Node">repository wiki</a>.

        <dt>Name</dt>

            The list containing the conditions for routing messages to output
            ports. New entries can be added using the button below the list.
            Existing entries can be reordered or deleted. Depending on the
            selected operator on the left side, the following possibilities are
            available:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>before</i>: Checks if the message ingress time is before
                    the specified time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>after</i>: Checks if the message ingress time is at or
                    after the specified time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>between</i>: Checks if the message ingress time is at or
                    between the two specified times.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>outside</i>: Checks if the message ingress time is before
                    the first or after the second specified time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>week days</i>: Checks if the message ingress date is at
                    one of the selected week days.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>months</i>: Checks if the message ingress date is at one
                    of the selected months.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>otherwise</i>: Evaluates to true if all other conditions
                    do not match.
                </li>
            </ul>
            For the time input, depending on the selection on the left side, the
            following possibilities are available:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>Time of Day</i>: A specific time can be entered directly
                    in the form <code>hh:mm[:ss] [am|pm]</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Sun Position</i>: The sun position can be selected from
                    a list of predefined values.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Moon Position</i>: The moon position can be selected from
                    a list of predefined values.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Custom</i>: One of the user-defined sun position names
                    can be entered.
                </li>
            </ul>
            The specified times can additionally be shifted by an (optionally
            randomized) offset, accessible through the double down arrow on the
            right side.
        </dd>
        <dt>Stop on first match</dt>
        <dd>
            If selected, evaluation of conditions is stopped on the first match,
            i.e. message are never routed to more than one output port.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Input</h3>
    <p>
        Incoming messages are routed to none, one or multiple of the configured
        output ports. If the message is delivered to more than one port, it will
        be cloned at each but the first port.
    </p>
    <h3>Outputs</h3>
    <p>
        Each output port is dedicated to a specific condition which is evaluated
        against the message's ingress time and date.
    </p>
