        Routes messages based on their ingress time and date.
    </p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>
        This node routes incoming messages to output ports based on the time
        and date of arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
        For more information, please refer to the detailed documentation in the
        <a href="https://github.com/jensrossbach/node-red-contrib-chronos/wiki/Time-Switch-Node">repository wiki</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Configuration</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt>Name</dt>
        <dd>The name of the node (optional).</dd>
        <dt>Configuration</dt>
        <dd>
            A reference to the configuration node to be used.
        </dd>
        <dt>Conditions</dt>
        <dd>
            The list containing the conditions for routing messages to output
            ports. New entries can be added using the button below the list.
            Existing entries can be reordered or deleted. Depending on the
            selected operator on the left side, there are fields for specifying
            times or time ranges (either directly entered, as sun or moon position
            based event or as user-defined sun position), selection of week days
            or selection of months. The condition with operator "otherwise" matches
            if all other conditions do not match.
        </dd>
        <dt>Stop on first match</dt>
        <dd>
            If selected, evaluation of conditions is stopped on the first match,
            i.e. message are never routed to more than one output port.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Input</h3>
    <p>
        Incoming messages are routed to none, one or multiple of the configured
        output ports. If the message is delivered to more than one port, it will
        be cloned at each but the first port.
    </p>
    <h3>Outputs</h3>
    <p>
        Each output port is dedicated to a specific condition which is evaluated
        against the message's ingress time and date.
    </p>
